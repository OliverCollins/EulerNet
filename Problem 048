//Tens, thenties, thirties ... don't change the value of the last ten digits
//Anything that ends with a 1 will have the number at the end of the self power (Ex. 31^31 = ...31, 101^101 = ...101)
//Anything that ends with a 2 if the digits before are even then last digit is 04 otherwise 6 (Ex. 102^102 = ...04, 912^912 = ...6)
//Anything that ends with a 5 will have the last two digits be equal to 5 * n (Ex. 5 * 35 = ...75 ... 35^35 = ...75, 5 * 115 = ...75 ... 115^115 = ...75) 
//Anything that ends with a 6 will also end in a 6 (256^256 = ...6, 16^16 = ...6)
